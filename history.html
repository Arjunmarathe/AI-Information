    <h1><i><u>History of AI</u></i></h1>
    <p>The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased
        data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.

        Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the US
        Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human
        reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects
        in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana
        were household names.

        This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, including
        decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human
        abilities.

        While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots that take over the world, the
        current evolution of AI technologies isnâ€™t that scary - or quite that smart. Instead, AI has evolved to provide
        many specific benefits in every industry. Keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health
        care, retail and more.</p>






    <h1><i><u>When was AI Made</i></u></h1>
    <p>The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the
        British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing, who described an abstract computing machine
        consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by symbol,
        reading what it finds and writing further symbols.However, the groundwork for AI began in the early 1900s, and
        the biggest strides were not made until the 1950s, but it wouldn't have been possible without the work of early
        experts in many different fields. John Von Neumann and Alan Turing were the founding fathers of the technology
        behind AI, making the transition from computers to 19th century decimal logic (which dealt with values from 0 to
        9) and machines to binary logic (which rely on Boolean algebra, dealing with more or less important chains of 0
        or 1). The IPL, information processing language, had already made it possible to write as early as 1956 the LTM
        (logic theorist machine) program which aimed to demonstrate mathematical theorems.</p>
