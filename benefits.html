    <h1>Benefits of AI</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits, including efficiency through task automation, data analysis for
        informed decisions, assistance in medical diagnosis, advancement of autonomous vehicles, and digital assistance.
        However, there are also drawbacks such as job displacement, ethical concerns about bias and privacy, security
        risks from hacking, and a lack of human-like creativity and empathy.0 AI aims to develop machines that can
        reason, learn, and understand in ways similar to humans to handle complicated problems more effectively than
        conventional computing techniques. Applications of AI technology include robotics, self-driving cars, picture
        identification, and natural language processing.1</p>

    <h1>Where is AI used</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in various industries, including medicine, transportation, robotics,
        science, education, the military, surveillance, finance, agriculture, entertainment, retail, customer service,
        and manufacturing.0 AI is the backbone of smart assistants, which can be accessed through most phones on the
        market and are being integrated into cars and smart home devices.4 Some high-profile applications of AI include
        advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, generative
        or creative tools, and competing at the highest level in strategic games.3 AI is also being tested and used in
        the healthcare industry for suggesting drug dosages, identifying treatments, and aiding in surgical procedures
        in the operating room.2 AI is being used mostly by companies to improve their process efficiencies, automate
        resource-heavy tasks, and make business predictions based on hard data rather than gut feelings.1</p>
